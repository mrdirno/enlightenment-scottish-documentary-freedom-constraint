## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where Isla secretly uses the Leica for the first time inside the Centre. What does she choose to photograph, and what does she see through its viewfinder that her sanctioned cameras miss?
- Create a journal entry from Fraser, the Senior Facilitator, revealing his private doubts about the Centre or a memory of what the glen was like before it was built.
- Write the 'Civic Contribution Through Constraint' pamphlet that Isla reads on the Transit, in full. Make its language reveal the ideology of this society.
- Imagine a conversation between Isla and the woman with the white knuckles from the refectory. Where does it happen, and what truth is exchanged?

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a 'Constraint Architecture' style guide: a set of rules for buildings, interiors, and soundscapes intended to enforce calm and compliance.
- Build a 'Sanctioned Camera Unit' simulator: a simple image filter/processor that blurs, smooths, or removes 'non-designated textures' (like cracks, chaotic patterns, intense emotions) from uploaded images.
